** SHERC RIC workshop Spring 2022

Title: Animated, Interactive Data Visualization: animint2 R package

Abstract: Data visualization is useful for understanding patterns in large data sets and models. 
In constrast with static data visualization which produces a single image rendered as a PDF/PNG/etc image file, interactive data visualization can show many images of a data set, by rendering to a web page which can be clicked in order to show/hide different details of the data set.
Interactive data visualization is useful for exploratory data analysis, for research, and for teaching.
This tutorial will explain how to create animated and interactive data visualizations using the animint2 R package.
It will cover chapters 2-4 of the animint2 Manual, https://rcdata.nau.edu/genomic-ml/animint2-manual/Ch02-ggplot2.html
Participants in this workshop should have R installed on their computer so they can follow along with the exercises.
Some prior knowledge of R and the ggplot2 package would be useful.
We will begin by explaining the basics of ggplots (grammar of graphics plots), including plot sketching, geoms, and aesthetic mappings from data variables to visual properties.
Next we will show how the animint() function can be used to render a list of ggplots on a web page.
Finally we will explain the showSelected and clickSelected keywords, which can be used to add interactivity to ggplots.
At the end of this workshop, participants should understand the basics of static and interactive data visualization using the grammar of graphics.
