Comparison of R packages that can produce interactive animations

All 4 methods below have these points in common:

- Interact with the plot to show/hide subsets of data.
- Animation.
- Multi-layer: several different geoms can be combined on the same plot (e.g. points and lines).
- The user only needs to write R code (not JavaScript).
- Plot rendered in a web browser using HTML and JavaScript.

Raster/bitmap image formats
- Portable Network Graphics (PNG).
- canvas is an HTML element which can be used with JavaScript to render a 2D raster image on a web page.

Vector image formats
- Scalable Vector Graphics (svg).

Text data formats
- JavaScript Object Notation (json).
- vega is a visualization grammar (a special case of json).
- Comma-separated values (csv) is for data tables.

Code formats (programming languages)
- JavaScript is for controlling web pages.
- Data-Driven Documents (D3) is a JavaScript library.

** animation 

If you want to interact with only one variable (time), then animation
is the best, since it offers a wide variety of export formats (web
page, MOV, animated GIF). To view an example, 
=source("animation.R")= in the WorldBank subdirectory.

** animint

If you want to interact with several variables (not just time), then
animint is the best. However, the only kind of interaction that can be
expressed using animint is showing and hiding subsets of data, based
on the selected value of each interaction variable. To view an
example, =source("animint.R")= in the WorldBank subdirectory.

** shiny + ggplot2 or ggvis

If you want other kinds of interactions, or you want to do
calculations on the server, then shiny is the best. Do
=shiny::runApp("shiny")= for ggplot2, and =shiny::runApp("ggvis")= for
ggvis. Due to some backwards-incompatible changes, you may need to run
=git checkout 3e0b8d379d15d51d29a4a7ba799741065abe3db2= to get a
version of ggvis that works with this example.

** Future work

A translator that takes a list of ggplots with showSelected and
clickSelects aesthetics, and outputs a shiny app.
